# Local split screen (prototype)

Two players on one PC: player 1 on keyboard, mouse and pad 1, player 2 on pad 2. The screen is split side by
side on wide screens and top and bottom on others. This is a prototype, off unless the environment variable
`TS_SPLIT=1` is set. The code is `native/split.c`; the static research behind it is in the private notes
(`work/re/splitscreen.md`).

## Why it has to be built

TimeShift on PC has no split-screen code left from the console versions. There is one local player, one camera,
one command context and one HUD, and each is a single global:

| What | Global | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| local player | `[0x1095b30]` and `[0xfc8180]` | the player constructor (`0x406750`) sets both, the destructor clears both |
| camera | `[0xfcabc4]` | a 0x360-byte object; the player's camera code writes it every frame |
| commands | input manager `[0xfcabb4]` + 0x40 | the active command context (`GAME` in play, `UI` in menus) |
| HUD | `[0x1095fc8]` | laid out on a 640x480-based virtual canvas (`[0xebfaac]` x `[0xebfab0]`) |
| sound listener | camera of `[0xfcabc4]` | FMOD listener 0, updated in the game update |

The mod therefore makes the second player out of the single-player pieces and swaps these globals at the right
moments of the frame.

## How it works

### The frame

With split screen on, the mod forces the engine's single-thread frame (what `[CONFIG] DisableMultithreading = 1`
does). Then one frame runs in this order on the main thread:

1. the game update (message 0x3e8: input evaluation, players, AI, scripts, sound listener);
2. the renderer's frame start (`R` vtable +0x1c, `0x67ee90`): it copies the camera into the view list and sets
   the visibility viewer;
3. the HUD update (`UI` vtable +0x114, `0x671da0`);
4. the render job (`0x649830`): Present of the previous frame, then the world, post-processing and HUD into an
   off-screen "pool" target, and one full-screen quad that copies the pool to the back buffer
   (call `0x987db0` at `0x770f42`);
5. the renderer's frame end (`R` vtable +0x24, `0x67f290`).

### Two views on alternate frames

Each frame renders one view, alternately player 1's and player 2's, through the engine's whole pipeline.
Visibility, shadows, post-processing and the HUD follow the view by themselves. From step 2 to step 5 the mod
sets:
- `[0xfcabc4]` = a copy of the view's camera with the field of view of a half screen. The vertical angle stays
  as the game set it for the whole screen and the horizontal angle follows the half's shape, so each half is a
  cut-out of a normal view, not a squeezed one;
- both player pointers = the view's player (HUD values, first-person weapon);
- the HUD canvas width = 480 x the half's aspect, so the HUD is laid out for a half screen. It is drawn over the
  whole picture and squeezed into the half together with the picture, which keeps its proportions.

The game update (step 1) always sees player 1's globals, so the sound listener follows player 1.

### Composite

The quad call at `0x770f42` is replaced. The current pool picture is copied into the view's own texture, and
both views' latest pictures are copied into their halves of the back buffer (`StretchRect`, linear filter). Each
half shows its view's newest frame, so nothing depends on the back buffer surviving Present. Each view runs at
half the frame rate.

Outside play (main menu, loading screens, pause menu, cutscenes with the scene camera) the screen is not split.

### Player 2

Player 2 is a second instance of the campaign class `player`, spawned next to player 1 a few seconds after the
level starts (`0x655460(no transform, "player2", "player", 0)`, then placed with the player's own vtable
+0x210). Its constructor takes both player pointers, so they are put back to player 1 right after the spawn.

Every frame, player 2's update (player vtable +0x13c, `0x4098c0`) runs with the globals swapped to player 2:
both player pointers, player 2's own camera object (the player's camera code writes `[0xfcabc4]`), its own command
context, and the input manager's look state (+0x28..+0x3b, +0x64..+0x73).

Player 2's command context is a copy of the `GAME` context with its own command entries, so it has the same
bindings, including the pad bindings of `gamepad.c`. The engine fills it with its own command evaluation
(`0x6595e0`). After the normal evaluation for player 1, the mod runs it a second time with:
- the raw input block of player 2 (current and previous codes, per-code state; `_inpINPUT` +0x10..+0x12a8),
  kept between frames, so press and release edges work;
- only the "keyboard" poll enabled, in which `gamepad.c` writes pad 2 into the joystick codes and leaves the
  keyboard and mouse codes idle (`gamepad_poll_player2`);
- player 2's context as the active one.

Player 1's raw input, context and look state are restored afterwards.

## Settings (environment, prototype)

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TS_SPLIT=1` | on |
| `TS_SPLIT_STAGE=1/2/3` | 1: the normal frame in one half; 2: a second camera (player 1's, offset) on alternate frames; 3 (default): player 2 |
| `TS_SPLIT_LAYOUT=v/h` | side by side / top and bottom (default: side by side when the screen is wider than 3:2) |
| `TS_SPLIT_MT=1` | keep the engine's worker threads (the split then stays off and says so in the log) |
| `TS_SPLIT_P2DELAY=s` | seconds after player 1 appears until player 2 is spawned (default 5) |
| `TS_SPLITLOG=1` | frame phases, threads, globals and the game state in the log |

Pad assignment is `gamepad.c`'s: player 1 gets the first connected pad (or `[Gamepad] Pad=`), player 2 the next one.
